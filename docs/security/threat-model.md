- ✅ Request timeouts and limits
- ✅ Resource usage monitoring
- ✅ Automated health checks

### 6. Elevation of Privilege (Authorization Threats)

#### Threat: Privilege Escalation
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Description**: Users gain unauthorized access to higher privilege levels
**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Principle of least privilege
- ✅ Regular access reviews
- ✅ Role-based permissions
- ✅ Secure coding practices
- ✅ Regular penetration testing

## Security Controls Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Firebase Security Rules Example
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Workout plans require authentication
    match /workoutPlans/{planId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Firebase handles encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3 enforced
- **Key Management**: Firebase manages encryption keys
- **Data Anonymization**: PII is hashed where possible

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Security Events**: Authentication failures, privilege changes
- **Audit Trail**: All data modifications logged
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual access patterns flagged
- **Incident Response**: Automated alerts for security events
